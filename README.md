# no-ghosts
A repo for baseline defense logic and queries for casp3r0x0 KeePassStealer.

## üìå Context
Recently (as of 8/31/2025), a public proof-of-concept called **KeePassStealer** was released.  
It demonstrates a red-team technique where a malicious DLL is injected into `KeePass.exe` and hooks the Windows API **`advapi32!SystemFunction041`** (`RtlDecryptMemory`).  
When KeePass decrypts the master password, the hook copies it out to disk.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This is not a break of KeePass encryption.  
It is a **post-compromise credential access technique** ‚Äî attackers already need code execution on the target host.  

- MITRE ATT&CK:  
  - **T1055** ‚Äì Process Injection  
  - **T1555.005** ‚Äì Credentials from Password Managers  

This repo highlights detection content I‚Äôve authored to defend against KeePass injection and similar API-hooking attempts.
